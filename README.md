# Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System

The project described on the website is a face recognition-based attendance system, which uses machine learning algorithms to automatically identify and record the attendance of individuals by analyzing their facial features. The system involves capturing images of individuals using a camera, and then using computer vision and machine learning techniques to extract facial features and compare them against a database of known faces. The system can then automatically mark the attendance of individuals based on the recognition results. This project could be used in a variety of settings, such as schools, universities, or workplaces, to simplify the attendance-taking process and reduce errors associated with manual attendance tracking.
